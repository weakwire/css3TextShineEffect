CSS3 simple animated text gradient effect

Include the textGradientEffect.js

Add class "slideEffect" to the div surrounding the text
and add a unique id to it .(data-id).

This is my first project in jquery. I hope i'll find a way so that data-id it not needed.

<div class="slideEffect" data-id="1">
   <h1>This will shine on hover ... and some useless text here just to show the effect</h1>
</div>
